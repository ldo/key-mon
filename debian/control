Description: A screencast utility that displays your keyboard and mouse status
 A screencast utility that displays your keyboard and mouse status
 Key-mon is useful for teaching since it shows the current status of your
 keyboard and mouse and you use them in another application.

 No longer do you need to say 'Now I'm pressing the Ctrl-D key', your students
 can just see the keystroke for themselves.
