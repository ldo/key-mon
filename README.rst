Key-mon
=======

A screencast utility that displays your keyboard and mouse status.

Key-mon is useful for live demos since it shows the current status
of your keyboard and mouse as you use them in another application. No
longer do you need to say 'Now I'm pressing the Ctrl-D key', your
audience can just see the keystroke for themselves.
